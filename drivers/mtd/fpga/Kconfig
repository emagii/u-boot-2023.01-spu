	  Enable driver model for FPGAs configurable using SPI.
	  This SPI FPGA interface
	  (spi_fpga_probe(), spi_fpga_write(), etc.) is then
	  implemented by the SPI FPGA uclass.
	  There is one standard SPI FPGA driver which knows how to probe
	  chips supported by U-Boot. The uclass interface is defined in
	  include/spi_fpga.h
	  SPI and SPI FPGA must be enabled together
	  (it is not possible to use driver model for one and not the other).
